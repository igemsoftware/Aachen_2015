# Aachen_2015
Welcome to the repo of the Master Control Program

With this software suite, anyone can control their own DIY bioreactors.

You can find much more information about the components of this software suite on our respective wiki page at: http://2015.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Software

## Requirements
+ Visual Studio 2013 or higher
+ Windows 7 or higher

## Notes on Compiling
To enable the simultaneous, configurable plotting of live data with support of multiple y-axes, we had to fix a bug in the Dynamic Data Display library version 4.0 (aka d3future). The compiled libraries of D3 with the correct modification are in the 'Dependencies' directory.
